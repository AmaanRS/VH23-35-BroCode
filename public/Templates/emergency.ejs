              (i) Push hard and fast on the center of the person's chest in a
              fairly rapid rhythm â€” about 100 to 120 compressions a minute. (ii)
              Begin CPR if the person is unconscious. If the person isn't
              breathing or you don't find a pulse, begin CPR to keep blood
              flowing after you call for emergency medical help.
